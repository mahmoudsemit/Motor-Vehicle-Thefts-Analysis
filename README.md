Stolen vehicle data from the New Zealand police department's vehicle of interest database containing 6 months of data. Each record represents a single stolen vehicle, with data on vehicle type, make, year, color, date stolen and region stolen. 

Based on the data I answered these questions which include:
1. Which regions have the most and least number of stolen vehicles?
2. What types of vehicles are most often and least often stolen?
3. What is the average age of the vehicles that are stolen? Does this vary based on the vehicle type?
4. What day of the week are vehicles most often and least often stolen?
